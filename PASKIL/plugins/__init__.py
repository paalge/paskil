"""
This package contains a few plugins that I wrote during the course of developing PASKIL. If you are
lucky enough to be using the same all-sky cameras as me, then you can use the same plugins and save
yourself the hassle of writing new ones. However, most of these plugins are rather incomplete, and 
I would advise you to take a look at the source code to see what they are doing before you try to 
use them!

This module also contains a PIL plugin for reading PMIS files as used to be produced by the UiO ASC.

Additionally, there is a template PASKIL plugin, which should help you to write your own plugins.
